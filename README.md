# Triple Modular Redundancy

### About:
Triple modular redundancy in which I have 3 identical systems, providing the same 3 outputs. I expect those outputs to be identical. However, that might not be the case. So, I implement a voting system: if at least 2 outputs are identical, I pick that output to be correct. If all 3 outputs are different, I have an error (y = '1').
